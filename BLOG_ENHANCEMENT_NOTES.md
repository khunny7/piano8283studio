# Blog Enhancement - Production Notes

## Demo Content Removal

The demo blog post (`src/data/demoBlogPost.ts`) was added to showcase the enhanced blog functionality. 

**For production deployment:**
1. Remove the demo post import from `src/routes/Blog.tsx` 
2. Remove the demo post from the posts array in `fetchFirestorePosts()`
3. Delete `src/data/demoBlogPost.ts`

This will restore the blog to show only actual Firestore content.

## Rich Text Editor Features

The blog now supports:
- **Rich Text Formatting**: Bold, italic, headers, lists, links
- **Code Blocks**: Syntax highlighted code with proper styling  
- **Images**: Featured images and inline images via URL
- **Safe Content**: HTML sanitization with DOMPurify
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly content display

## Admin Interface

The BlogAdmin component now includes:
- React-Quill WYSIWYG editor
- Featured image URL input with preview
- Enhanced post management with rich content
- Safe HTML storage and retrieval

## Security

- All HTML content is sanitized before storage
- XSS protection via DOMPurify
